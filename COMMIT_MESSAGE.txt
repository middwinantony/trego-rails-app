Fix critical security vulnerabilities and complete database schema

CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES:
- Fix privilege escalation in user signup (removed :role from params)
- Fix authorization bypass in rides show action (use @ride from before_action)
- Add missing return statements after renders in authorization guards
- Restrict CORS to ENV-based origins (no longer allows all origins)
- Add password validation (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, digit required)

DATABASE SCHEMA FIXES:
- Add location columns (pickup_location, dropoff_location) to rides
- Add timestamp columns (assigned_at, started_at) to rides
- Add city_id foreign keys to rides and users tables
- Implement vehicles table schema (make, model, year, plate_number, driver_id)
- Add model associations for User, Ride, Vehicle, and City models

MISSING CONTROLLERS:
- Create Admin::RidesController with index action and pagination
- Create UsersController with show action and authorization
- Complete Admin::UsersController with index, show, and update actions
- Add update route for admin users management

DEPENDENCIES:
- Add Kaminari gem for pagination support

FIXES:
- Fix Ride model validation (change validates to validate for custom validation)

This commit addresses all critical security issues and completes the
foundation for the ride-sharing application. The app is now ready for
advanced features like background jobs, Redis caching, and payments.
